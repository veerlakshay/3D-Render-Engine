# 3D Renderer Engine

This project is a simple 3D renderer engine built in Java, using the `javax.swing` library for GUI and basic graphics. The renderer displays 3D objects composed of triangles and allows users to rotate the view with horizontal and vertical sliders. The application includes basic shading to give the 3D effect a realistic touch.

## Features

- **3D Rendering** of shapes composed of triangles
- **Rotation Control** via horizontal and vertical sliders
- **Shading** based on the triangle's angle relative to the view
- **Basic Subdivision** for smoother shapes through the `inflate` function
- **Z-Buffer Implementation** to handle depth and render the correct object order
